<h1>Artist Statement</h1>
<div class='biotext'>
My work explores the interplay between Platonic ideals and their imperfect, material manifestations. In this regard, materials are very important to me; I pay attention to the warping of twine, the refraction of plastic, or the resonance of different kinds of wood. Many of my projects begin with playing with a material to tease out the properties I want to highlight in my work. Other projects begin with ideas and often mathematical concepts. I think "suppose I inscribe a sphere inside of a cube, what would that sculpture look like?" I then begin to ascribe materials and methods to my idea and and installation begins to take shape. In both cases, my decisions are informed by the space that I am installing in. From small sketch models come large installations that are meant to be occupied and walked around. Each installation is another exploration of my understanding of space and materiality. I hope that the viewer feels immersed in a new and alluring perceptual environment with each of my works.
